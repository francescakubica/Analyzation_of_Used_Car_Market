# Analyzation_of_Used_Car_Market

Skills gained: data analysis, data wrangling, modeling. 

This project was completed in a team of 6, with 2 of us each taking on seperate subsets of data based off of price range. 
Work is labeled if it wasn't written by me. The inital data wrangling to remove substantial outliers was done as a team, and further recommendations were found within each subset afterwards.

This presentation goes through our steps for analyzation, models, and industry recommendations. Includes an appendix with extra information about significant correlations found between variables and depreciation of used-cars. 

I focused on the Economy subset of brands. 

Obstacles:
Some upper-end economy cars were outliers and had to be removed even though they were considered economy. The QQ plot was also vering off toward the end and top so individual cars had to be picked out to remove skew, and variables shown in visualizations were logged to produce a more read-able picture. It was difficult finding the exact causes for why a car depreciated besides its mileage. This is why I solved this by simply using price as a depreciation measure and found brands that depreciated the least. 

Conclusion:

Purchase a Buy a Mitsubishi if depreciation is a concerning factor. Do not purchase a Subaru given the same condition. Industries that rent out used cars should use depreciation as a main factor for purchasing brands so they can continue to use the car and retain value. Given this, if they want an economy car, they should purchase a Mitsubishi. 

Estimations:

2022 Mitsubishi vs 2019 Mitsubishi

Depreciated: 18.7%

2022 Subaru vs 2019 Subaru

Depreciation: 23.9%
